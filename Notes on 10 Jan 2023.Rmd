git --> keeping control of files; takes snapshots of files.  
types of files (also good for version control):   
  -plain text
-R scripts
-markdown (.md/.Rmd)
* type of its formatting language used in R (.Rmd)
-html
-LaTEx

bad for version control in github bc you can't keep track of changes:
  -pdfs
  -videos/pics
  -word doc
  
  note: we're always commit changes (keeps track of changes) and changing files until we're ready to push 
  pushing --> transfering changes from local repo (computer) to Github repo
  we can also pull. to pull is to make changes from Github repo to local repo
