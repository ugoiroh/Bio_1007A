`Assign to the variable n_dims a single random integer between 3 and 10.`
```{r}
n_dims <- sample(3:10, size=1)
```

`Create a vector of consecutive integers from 1 to n_dims2` 
```{r}
n_dims2 <- (1:n_dims^2)
```
`Use the sample function to randomly reshuffle these values.`
```{r}
sample(n_dims2)
```
`create a square matrix with these elements` 
```{r}
#my_vec <- 1:16
table <- matrix(data=sample(n_dims2), nrow=n_dims)
```
`print out the matrix.`
```{r}
print(table)
```
`find a function in r to transpose the matrix.`  
```{r}
t(table)
```

`print it out again and note how it has changed.`
```{r}
print(t(table))
```

`calculate the sum and the mean of the elements in the first row and then the last row.`
```{r}
mean(table[1,])
mean(table[n_dims,])
```
`set your code up so you can re-run it to create a matrix of a different size by only changing the n_dims value`

`# reshape(table)`
