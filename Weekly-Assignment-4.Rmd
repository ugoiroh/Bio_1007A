`Simulate a brand new data frame (the type of data is up to you) and conduct a statistical analysis in R using 2 variables. Create a basic ggplot that goes with the analysis.`

```{r}
###Load Libraries  
library(ggplot2)
library(ggthemes)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)

#Check and Load data
d <- ChickWeight
summary(ChickWeight) #gives me more relevant data for what I will plot + ANOVA analyses

#weight and time are both continuous so I think I have to do a linear regression model. ##Question: Is there a relationship between chick weight and time?

#remember, yVar~xVar
#Linear regression analysis
regModel <- lm(weight~Time, data=ChickWeight) 
summary(regModel)
summary(regModel)$"r.squared" #mean of coefficient
plot(ChickWeight$Time, ChickWeight$weight) #quick plot of what it could look like

#Making a scatterplot with this data
regPlot <- ggplot(data=regModel, aes(x=Time, y=weight)) +
  geom_point(size=2) +
  stat_smooth(method=lm, se=0.99) #lets say we want to add a linear regression, se=standard error
regPlot + theme_few() + labs(x = "Time of Feed (min) ", y = "Weight of Chicks (oz)") 

```
