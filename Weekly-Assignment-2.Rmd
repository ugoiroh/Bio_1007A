**1. Create a function that returns a data frame with 2 columns (named “Type” and “Value”) and 50 rows/observations:**

`The first column should have “Control” as the first 25 observations and “Treatment” as the second half of observations. The second column should have the first 25 values as random and normally distributed with a mean of 10 and standard deviation of 1.5. The next 25 values of the second column should be random and normally distributed with a mean of 45 and standard deviation of 2.`  

```{r}
Type <-c(rep("Control",25), rep("Treatment",25))
Value <- c(rnorm(n=25, mean=10, sd=1.5), rnorm(n=25, mean=45, sd=2))
df <- data.frame(Type, Value)
print(df)
```


  * The arguments of your function should be the two means of the random normal numbers. The body of the function can be a single line of code (if you want a challenge) or broken up into multiple code blocks.
  
**2. Save your new function’s output as a variable, and view the first 6 rows of the data frame.**
```{r}
head(df)
```

**3. Let’s say you would like to know whether there is a statistically significant difference in “Value” (response variable y) depending on “Type” (explanatory variable x). Type ?aov in the console to determine how to run an analysis of variance (ANOVA) on your simulated data. The formula is written as yVar~xVar with yVar as the column name of your response variable and xVar as the column name of your explanatory variable. Write a line of code that displays a summary of your ANOVA.**

```{r}
df.aov <- aov(Value ~Type, data = df)
summary(df.aov)
```


**4. Finally create a function that uses a data frame as its input and returns only the p-value of an ANOVA summary table (feel free to use Google/Stack Overflow). Write your code in such a way that you can use any simulated data set with two columns (i.e. the output of your first function) as your ANOVA function’s argument.**

```{r}

```
