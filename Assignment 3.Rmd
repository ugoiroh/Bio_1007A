# Assignment 3

`Question One`  
```{r}
x <- 1.1
a <- 2.2
b <- 3.3

z <- x^a^b
print(z)
```

```{r}
z <- ((x^a))^(b)
print(z)
```
```{r}
z <- (3*x^(3))+(2*x^(2))+(1)
print(z)
```
`Question Two`
```{r}
z <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8)
print(z)
z <- c(seq(from = 1, to = 8,), seq(from = 7, to = 1)) 
print(z)
```
```{r}

print(z)

print(z)
```
```{r}
z <- c(rep(5, each = 1), rep(4, each = 2), rep(3, each = 3), rep(2, each = 4), rep(1, each = 5)) 
print(z)
```
`Question Three`
```{r}
queue <- c("sheep", "fox", "owl", "ant")
print(queue)
#the serpent arrives and gets in the back of the line. 
queue <- c("sheep", "fox", "owl", "ant")
queue <- c(queue[1:4], "serpent")
print(queue)

#the sheep enters the club (so disappears from the line).  
queue[-c(1)]

#the donkey arrives and talks his way to the front of the line. 
queue <- c("fox", "owl", "ant", "serpent")
queue <- c("donkey", queue[1:4])
print(queue)

#the serpent gets impatient and leaves;
queue <- queue[-c(5)]
print(queue)

#the aphid arrives and the ant invites him to cut in line (hint: check out the append function).
queue <- append(queue,"aphid", after = 3)
print(queue)

#Finally, determine the position of the aphid in the line (hint: use the which function).  
which(queue=="aphid")
```
